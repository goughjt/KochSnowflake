# KochSnowflake
A simple Tkinter python app to inefficiently generate and visualize the iterative growth (but not anti-growth) of a Koch Snowflake  

It is badly commented and not really useful at all but it was good fun to make.

This programme requires TKinter and opencv.

I made this with Geany in Ubuntu 14.04.
